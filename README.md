Abstract:
The objective of this project is to build a ML model for heart disease prediction based on the related parameters. We have used a benchmark dataset of UCI Heart disease prediction for this research work, which consist of 14 different parameters related to Heart Disease. 

Machine Learning algorithms such as K-Neighbours Classifier Model, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier have been used for the development of model.
